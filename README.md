# Modified-ORB_SLAM-for-opencv-3-or-later

This code is originally written by Gao xiang, author of 《视觉SLAM十四讲》. It is a good example for learners of SLAM, but it is only compatible with opencv2. So I modified it and made some exception handling strategies to ensure it could run normally in opencv3 or later. 

Detailed tutorials could be seen in Gao xiang's blog:
